                                Once I adopted my beloved bulldog puppy, Elsa. <br/><br/>
                                To say sheâ€™s a chewer is an understatement!  And guess what was her favourite toy? My shoes! <br/><br/>
                                Therefore I created a range of boredom-busting edible shoes that Elsa could enjoy chewing that would also clean her teeth. <br/><br/>
                                Just like the dental chews I gave her at dinner-time to stop her staring at my plate!
